5,Item: Default,2025-05-26 03:18:22,"Super convenient to assemble. Easy to keep up with parts. Had many different brushes and parts to clean walls, mirrors, floors, baseboards. Best steamer I have seen so far. I have only had four a couple days so my review is fresh and not old. Quality of work: 9/10 Design: 10/10 Performance: 8/10"
4,Item: Default,2025-05-26 01:00:16,"Just bought this recently and it’s broken from inside where you put the water ☹️ but the times that I use it, It did Work great."
4,Item: Default,2025-05-25 21:09:05,"I love this steamer. I use every attachment. The least favorite it the mop piece tho, mine doesn’t get as hot and steamy as I’ve seen others, I feel like it doesn’t fit in the attachment part fully. But all other accessories make this purchase worth while. I use it almost everyday!"
5,Item: Default,2025-05-25 20:52:50,Very nice steamer mop! It works great and I am very happy with my purchase. I definitely recommend this product to anyone. It is also lightweight and very easy to use
1,Item: Default,2025-05-25 20:19:47,I got in empty open box with no vacuum just left overs it looks like someone return . Super upset and there taking forever to respond to me.

5,Item: Default,2025-05-25 11:41:09,Loving it so far! I’ve used it around the sink fixtures and toilets— which is the main reason I got it and it’s working great!
1,Item: Default,2025-05-25 09:59:21,My mop must me defective I read all the reviews and was so excited to get mine but it doesn’t clean like I expected. Mine doesn’t seem to get hot enough to get a good steam clean.
4,Item: Default,2025-05-25 08:41:42,"We absolutely love our Schenley 7 in one Mop. It heats up quickly, is very versatile, and does a good job cleaning all kinds of surfaces and areas. My only complaint would be that the water tank is too small and requires refilling way too often. Otherwise, I would’ve given this 5 stars."
5,Item: Default,2025-05-25 05:33:38,This product really works on getting any gunk or dust on any surface even baseboards and windows without you having to bend down. The steam really melts everything away. I’d suggest also purchasing the reusable pink pads as well. Performance: Great

4,Item: Default,2025-05-23 22:31:31,I like it. It definitely gets steamy and for the most part it lifted hard to get spots that I normally have to scrub. The water does run out fast and I wish it came with some kind of station to store it and all the parts.
5,Item: Default,2025-05-23 22:11:05,I love this steam mop. It works wonders . I never thought steam could clean so good. It comes with all the attachments you need for small spaces. This is my go to cleaning tool now

Lightweight and to simple use it’s a true game-changer for a pristine home."
2,Item: Default,2025-05-23 16:55:19,I bought this after seeing some of the review videos of all the steam coming out and mine does not heat uo in 15 seconds and has the smallest trickle of steam coming out on the highest setting. I'm pretty disappointed in this steam mop. Maybe I got a faulty one.

3,Item: Default,2025-05-11 00:40:08,I loved this steamer cleaner . I used daily until it started leaking from The tank where you add the water . It’s a constant leak I can’t use it anymore. I want another one but I need it to last more than a couple months if it was that long

5,Item: Default,2025-05-10 17:45:33,I just got it in the mail and opened it. I’m a little worried because it does need to sit awhile before putting it away or taking it apart because it’s so hot.

4,Item: Default,2025-05-08 16:34:49,"It’s a good product and easy to use. It being pluggable and not chargeable is a challenge.

1,Item: Default,2025-04-24 17:33:45,This is not as great as everybody made it out to be. The on-off function is a little difficult to maneuver even if you hold it down it doesn’t quite indicate when it’s turned off. The rubber seal at the top isn’t secure and it’s difficult to open. There’s a lot more but I’m limited on characters.

2,Item: Default,2025-04-17 09:48:13,The product is okay for the price. The sponge attachments fell apart first use. The steam power isn't enough to burn you like my bissell But overall I'm okay with it.

5,Item: Default,2025-04-13 19:04:25,"I bought this mop to use after our demo of our new house. Let's just say I've used on every surface imaginable.

2,Item: Default,2025-04-13 16:19:53,"OVERHYPED! I think I'm going to do a full review on my page about it. This steam mop is NOT worth the hype. I bought it to use on my walls and floors.

4,Item: Default,2025-04-11 08:47:51,It cleans amazingly. I just wish it had a square base or something so it wouldn’t roll when I set it down.
2,Item: Default,2025-04-11 06:41:04,The sponge attachments ripped on first use and you gotta put in elbow grease to get anything off the walls

4,Item: Default,2025-04-09 20:24:29,"I’m still testing this steamer mop; I actually do like it so far. What I notice when it’s on the third steam, the water tends to go out faster and gotta keep refilling it. Most of the attachments is amazing, the scrub pad one could have been more stable. One time use and it already looks worn out. Performance: 10"

1,Item: Default,2025-04-09 09:15:06,"this steam mop is not all is cracked up to be used it twice. The steam is really hot, but very little cleaning and not enough water coming out of the tube."

2,Item: Default,2025-04-08 13:58:34,Item is a piece of crap. Hardly puts out any steam. This first one was broken. I contacted the company through email and they quickly shipped out a new one. One I bought off Amazon is better. It’s not with it . You don’t need it. Save your money.
5,Item: Default,2025-04-08 13:56:09,Excellent product and great quality. Only thing I would love for them to do in the future is to make one without a wire. Other than that this product is excellent.
4,Item: Default,2025-04-08 13:15:39,Performance: Overall performance of this steamer is great. I love all of the different attachments and options. Quality of work: The quality overall is good but can be better in terms of its sturdiness regarding the attachments.
1,Item: Default,2025-04-08 12:08:10,I was excited for this product! But I was quickly disappointed because It doesn’t work like the videos portray that it does. I was also able to find another streamer for a cheaper price that works the same.
5,Item: Default,2025-04-08 10:09:42,Very good product.
5,Item: Default,2025-04-08 03:15:03,The steam mop is amazing! I was not expecting the results I have witnessed. I steamed my floor grout and I was amazed!

5,Item: Default,2025-04-06 21:20:40,"Nice to use, a bit of getting use to in terms of using a mop that needs to be plugged in and having to step over what was already mopped to unplug the device. Pretty quick too."

4,Item: Default,2025-03-28 17:04:37,I wish the steam was a little more intense and that I could add detergent of some sort (it’s a mind over matter thing) otherwise it works amazing.
4,Item: Default,2025-03-28 15:34:56,"Love its cleaning power. Some of the attachments look pretty worn out after one use. I’ll have to see if I can buy replacements. Do not, I repeat Do NOT, accidentally hit your skin. I got a pretty nasty burn. No clue how I did that lol."

5,Item: Default,2025-03-09 14:13:16,I love it so far. Have cleaned my baseboards and floors. I did do the walls but you have to be careful because it will take the paint off. Next on my to do list is my oven so hopefully it lives up to my expectations.
5,Item: Default,2025-03-09 11:06:47,Calidad del trabajo: Me gustó este limpiador si lo recomiendo.
2,Item: Default,2025-03-09 09:46:41,Not as good as advertised.
1,Item: Default,2025-03-09 09:29:44,Doesn’t work like I thought it would

5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 22:33:37,Love it! Made my kitchen floors look brand new!
5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 19:55:39,Immediately started using live it
3,Item: Default,2025-03-08 19:50:36,Effective but definitely not as powerful as I would have hoped.
1,Item: Default,2025-03-08 19:03:13,I’m not a fan of this particular product. I really think it’s over hyped. It feels super cheap when you’re trying to mop your floor it feels like it’s going to snap in half. Don’t waste your money .
5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 16:40:09,Wow I really love this
5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 15:17:25,We have 9 animals and 4 people in our home. This is my go to for my floors and deep cleaning projects. Best purchase I have made!
1,Item: Default,2025-03-08 14:49:41,"I was really excited to get this, but I’m pretty disappointed. The one I received has a crack in it first time using it. It started dripping water. That’s how I found the crack really wish they would’ve inspected before they sent. I don’t even know how to return or get a replacement 😔 help pls!"
5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 13:25:48,"After an issue with my first mop, a replacement was sent by fast! It totally lived up to the hype. Love it!"
5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 11:22:16,You’ll never have to hire a professional. Amazing

5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 09:53:36,Love this! I’ve got so much cleaned in the house with this product!
3,Item: Default,2025-03-08 09:04:50,"Average, mediocre, not special. I had this steam mop in my cart for months but I'll be honest, the tiktok community hyped this to be a product that it is not. The water canister is very small, the actual mop pads are very thin, the pole of the lock is flimsy. Save your money."
5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 00:29:25,Loving my steamer!
5,Item: Default,2025-03-08 00:28:30,Nice
1,Item: Default,2025-03-07 23:32:59,This is not how i expected
1,Item: Default,2025-03-07 23:15:17,"I was very excited to purchase this steam mop, but honestly I’m not even a little bit impressed. It’s nice that it comes with multiple attachments, but the power of the actual device in it of itself is very poor. I would much rather stick to Shark for steam mops moving forward."
5,Item: Default,2025-03-07 21:35:07,"I love! She looks so fancy and pink and cleans everything! I cleaned my walls, doors, floors, microwave, stove, windows and mirrors already and they’re shiny clean :)"
4,Item: Default,2025-03-07 20:20:08,"I think this mop works so well!! I am able to clean everything in my house. It does take a bit of effort on the stove and oven but works better than scrubbing alone! One of the pieces on mine doesn’t fit very well and doesn’t click in, so that’s the only thing that I have an issue with."
5,Item: Default,2025-03-07 19:08:54,Love......Works amazing!!!

2,Item: Default,2025-03-07 14:38:55,"Was not impressed. It was more work with this mop than a traditional, didn’t clean well with other attachments."
4,Item: Default,2025-03-07 13:53:18,Only thing is the scrub brushes kind of broke down after one use. But everything else is great
5,Item: Default,2025-03-07 13:03:09,Best steam cleaner I have ever owned! Makes cleaning a breeze!! My home smells fresh and clean without overwhelming scents of chemicals. I cannot believe how quickly I was able to clean my entire kitchen from top to bottom! Def worth the hype!! 🩷🩷🩷🩷

5,Item: Default,2025-03-04 07:35:09,"I cannot say enough about this mop. I first used it on my master bathroom which had been neglected, so the steam cleaning was necessary.

3,Item: Default,2025-03-04 07:01:36,I was expecting more. Doesn't work on stove and fridge like videos show. One good thing is that it’s light and my 13 yo can easily maneuver to assist with cleaning the floors. I wouldn’t purchase again.
1,Item: Default,2025-03-04 04:41:13,Came with loose items that I believe don’t allow to work correctly so sounds like something is broken in the middle

5,Item: Default,2025-03-03 12:09:44,Obsessed is an understatement!!!
1,Item: Default,2025-03-03 11:46:18,The accessory for window cleaning already broke on the second use. Not worth the money.

5,Item: Default,2025-03-02 12:11:25,Perfect size and color was my favorite. During my move out process it made cleaning the floors a breeze. It snowed and there was so much mud it was ridiculous but my steam mop cleaned it right on up and the crayon writing on the wall was gone this steam mop saved me and my deposit.
3,Item: Default,2025-03-02 11:59:55,"One of the attachment broke first day of using it, but works well"
5,Item: Default,2025-03-02 11:02:11,Cleans my walls perfectly !
3,Item: Default,2025-03-02 11:00:03,I had high hopes. It’s ok. Maybe I was expecting something a little bit more powerful. It did really well on my floors but not the walls and grout. Cleans the windows but you still have to go clean the streaks with like a microfiber towel.
5,Item: Default,2025-03-02 10:38:06,"Design: I love this steam mop, it's so versatile. It can be a mop or hand held steamer. Performance: Which came in handy after I moved into a house that had past smoke covering all my cabinets. All that gunk practically melted off and it was shiney clean. I would buy this again and highly recommend it for others too."
5,Item: Default,2025-03-02 09:24:34,10/10
1,Item: Default,2025-03-02 04:40:04,Hate the cord. It drives me insane. It holds little water so you have to refill the water constantly and mind you it’s distilled water so you go thru a gallon pretty fast. Not a fan of it at all mostly because of the cord.
5,Item: Default,2025-03-02 02:36:12,Love it
1,Item: Default,2025-03-01 23:34:35,When I opened it the product looked like it had been used and it doesn't work as good as the make it look on the videos. I was very disappointed.

5,Item: Default,2025-03-01 20:47:37,"Just purchased and I’m loving it already. Only did my floor, outside of the refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher. Doing the inside of the stove next. It’s definitely a must buy!"

1,Item: Default,2025-03-01 11:48:34,If I could give 0 stars I would. The can’t even use it because the rod will not attach to either end. I was so excited to order after seeing all the videos but this was a major let down!!

4,Item: Default,2025-02-14 23:48:32,The steam as a mop is not very strong so not the best at cleaning floors the handheld option is better but I was hoping for more of the mop part. For the price I don't feel it was truly worth it. The customer service was excellent however.

Also, despite the claims, it doesn’t really get stains off walls. That said, it’s still a decent cleaning tool for basic jobs. Just don’t expect miracles!"

1,Item: Default,2025-01-29 10:33:56,"Looks cute, doesn't work. I contacted the company and they sent out a second one with the same issue--no steam coming out, but heating working and there was a clicking noise. Never heard back 🤷‍♀️"

5,Item: Default,2025-01-28 09:55:55,This has been so amazing and easy to use! Just fill the tank and go. It really makes cleaning a breeze. My only draw back is I wish it could stand up on its own. I have to prop it against something when I’m moving my furniture around. Maybe something to consider in any future designs.
2,Item: Default,2025-01-28 09:46:47,"The mop portion isn’t very strong compared to my shark. The attachments do not just make dirt and grime disappear like in the video, it smears it and makes it mud like so you have to back and clean it anyway."

4,Item: Default,2025-01-20 21:38:08,I love the handheld option! I did the tile in my bathroom and it took off all the soap scum buildup. The floor option is just okay. My floors are left streaky and the microfiber attachment just pushed dirt around more than attaching.

1,Item: Default,2025-01-14 23:32:40,"Unfortunately need to retract my initial positive review, it’s only been a couple of months of use and the whole mop is falling apart. Plastic body is cracking and bending everywhere, attachments didn’t last long at all, also the steam intensity weakened considerably. Very disappointed"

5,Item: Default,2025-01-12 22:41:45,Easy to use and has so many attachments. The only con is plugging it in turns it on instead of an on button and it can be a little tricky changing the levels and switching it off- but it works really well and looks nice. Steam cleans tough to reach places well

4,Item: Default,2024-12-19 10:12:40,"Works great. The only complaint is when I use it on the walls or any vertical surfaces, the water doesn't stem because of the upright position. I would have to stop, put the wand down to start steaming again, and then work in sections."

3,Item: Default,2024-12-19 02:37:56,Very good product. The only thing I did not like was that the soft cloth gets dirty a lot and it is very hard to get the dirt of it even with washing it multiple times. One of my scrubbers did break due to it not being completely glued.

3,Item: Default,2024-12-18 14:48:38,I think this product is alright. It comes with many different attachments and I’m sure if I run out of mop attachments I can use towels or other items. So far it’s helped to take off dirt and grime I didn’t realize we had. I feel like I still have to scrub a good amount while using this product.
4,Item: Default,2024-12-18 14:46:11,I used it to clean the walls in my bathroom. My walls looked as if they were just painted.

1,Item: Default,2024-12-18 08:21:26,Not what I expected. It’s not working like I’d hoped and the water tank is too small. I have to refill it too many times for just trying to clean one item.

2,Item: Default,2024-12-15 20:02:04,"When the floor steamer attachment is on, it’s underwhelming. When I take that part off, it’s pretty strong steam. Doesn’t turn all the way off unless it’s unplugged. What a waste of money."

1,Item: Default,2024-12-15 14:46:35,Terrible! I've had this mop for 2 months & its already broken. It can't even handle moderate scrubbing. The top part of the handle cracked b/c the mop is made of cheap material. On top of that there is no on/off button. Don't waste your money on this poorly designed and cheap made steam mop.
4,Item: Default,2024-12-15 13:37:22,"Worth the price. It is not the best but for how cheap I paid, I got its use out of it. The sponges were my favorite but wore off from the hot steam after the 3rd use. Easy to fix and continue on. I'm glad I bought it."
5,Item: Default,2024-12-15 12:17:52,This product is truly amazing.. it has made my cleaning experience really good. Especially when cleaning our shower the tools it brings help with scrubbing and leaving everything clean. 10/10 recommend!!

4,Item: Default,2024-12-14 06:44:39,"Initially, I loved this mop. It takes a lot of the hard work out of those annoying task around the house, like cleaning the grout, windows, showers and tubs as well as hard stuck on grease in and on your stove. Definitely worth every penny! But the brushes don't last super long. My only negative!"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-14 02:32:13,I love the color and works really good
5,Item: Default,2024-12-14 02:32:09,Very strong steam light weight! I love it totally worth it
5,Item: Default,2024-12-13 22:35:59,Seriously best one yet!! It does its job. Comes with everything you need and the cord is long enough. The tank is 250mLs but I cleaned my entire living room and kitchen and still had water left.

4,Item: Default,2024-12-13 19:11:32,"It’s a good product. I like the overall idea of it. I feel like the head rotates too freely though so when I was using it to try to clean spots on the wall as I’ve seen people in other video reviews do, the head wanted to flip over easy and turn. I felt this was inconvenient. Overall it is good!"
3,Item: Default,2024-12-13 19:09:23,Gets to wet to my liking
3,Item: Default,2024-12-13 18:24:58,Not sure how I feel about this one. It is not as powerful as I anticipated. It takes more elbow grease than I had hoped for. The floor mop part is soft on the steam and it takes a bit to build up to it. I appreciated the short version of it but once extended the power wasn’t as strong.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-13 15:02:40,Excited to use this item!

4,Item: Default,2024-12-13 09:46:58,Worth it! I was a little bummed that both sponge attachments broke/came apart after only using them each once (which is why i gave it 4stars instead of 5).

5,Item: Default,2024-12-13 03:19:54,"The Hestia has gotten more use in our house as a deep cleaner than a mop and I wouldn’t change that. It’s incredibly easy to use, it does require a little elbow grease to get THICK residue like burned on oven char, but the thing is: it DOES get it. I’d recommend this to anyone who needs to clean."

5,Item: Default,2024-12-09 19:50:18,This thing ROCKS! it’s super light weight & gets EVERYTHING squeaky clean! The cord is super long in comparison to other steam cleaners and it’s not a gawky cord so it’s easy to maneuver! 10/10

5,Item: Default,2024-12-08 23:00:36,"I love it, it cleans very well even mold/mildew. It is easy to use, not too heavy or hard to push and I love that it comes apart into a hand held steamer too."
5,Item: Default,2024-12-08 21:23:18,The best feature is that you can turn it upside down and still maintain steam. Others require it to be upright. I’m very pleased

3,Item: Default,2024-12-08 00:35:26,Good steamer I do recommend this however the attachments the ones that you need most or smaller attachments which makes it harder and also they’re so easy to fall apart like the sponge instantly it fell apart and the brushes gets worn out fast and it sucks that you’re not able to buyadditional

5,Item: Default,2024-12-07 14:28:05,"Absolutely LOVE this product! I clean houses for a living and the first house the time was cut tremendously! House looked fabulous! Item is sturdy and built great, doesn’t run out of water too quick, the size is also able to be broken up!!!"

5,Item: Default,2024-12-07 09:25:39,"I love it so far, it makes cleaning a lot easier. Only thing I don't like so far is the sponge head broke the first use."
5,Item: Default,2024-12-07 09:24:02,"This steam mop is definitely worth the hype it’s been getting. I was skeptical as usual (especially with hyped up products) it’s places that I’ve used so many different products on that didn’t work .. I was amazed! Also, if you have kids that love drawing on walls-this takes care of it with ease."
5,Item: Default,2024-12-07 09:23:28,Love this product.
4,Item: Default,2024-12-07 09:18:37,"So after using this a few times I feel confident in writing a true review. To start off the mop was packaged very well, easy to assemble and change accessories. I do truly love this and use it weekly in my cleaning. My down side is when using it with small attachments the cord gets in the way."
1,Item: Default,2024-12-07 08:25:00,"I spoke with the company weeks ago and told them that I was missing a part to my steamer, they said they would send it, they never did. Also the mop leaves your floors sticky and doesn't do a good job"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-07 08:21:27,This mop works really well! I used it on my laminant floor and it got up a lot of gunk. I'm going to use it in my shower soon to see how well it steams off the dead skin!!
5,Item: Default,2024-12-07 07:54:51,"So far I’ve used my Schenley steam mop twice. I love it. It has gotten up really tuff marks on my floors and has made my floors shine so much brighter than other mops. I’m so excited to try it next on my baseboards, walls, and kitchen cabinets."
5,Item: Default,2024-12-07 07:31:42,"Wow! I’m amazed at the fast shipping time, especially this time of year. It is a Christmas gift so I can’t comment on the quality or function of the steam mop yet but I will update after the mop is opened and used. 100% A+ seller as far as shipping though!!!"

5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 23:55:46,"i LOVE this steam mop, it came with 2 mop pads and multiple attachments :)) it works lovely and i will definitely be on the lookout for even more attachments possible in the future 🫶🏼"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 23:50:12,Works really well!!
2,Item: Default,2024-12-06 23:49:50,"Honestly, get a scrub brush and some cleaner, it works faster. This took a lot more time and effort to get half the normal result. A total waste of time."

4,Item: Default,2024-12-06 21:34:46,I think all the reviews have been mostly accurate. I wish it had more pressure behind it
1,Item: Default,2024-12-06 21:24:15,Missing parts. I don’t have the cone connection thing so I can’t even use it
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 21:15:47,I’m obsessed!!! Going around my house cleaning everything. This thing is amazing! If you’ve been eyeing it up get it! It’s worth every penny. I tell everyone about how much I love it!
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 20:52:00,"Love this!!! Great price and actually works, very happy !"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 20:40:21,Cleaned every surface of my home
2,Item: Default,2024-12-06 20:36:33,It steams well however one of the attachment sponge pieces already broke up from the piece it’s attached too on the first day of use! Appears to be weak in quality
3,Item: Default,2024-12-06 20:33:43,It overheats too much and stops working. I have to give a break and then continue.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 20:23:31,"The ONLY complaint I have is the water tank isn’t very big, but not a deal breaker… I wasn’t expecting it to work this good.. we just bought a brand new double wide and I wanted something to help me keep it clean without killing myself!! Don’t hesitate, just buy it!! It’s worth every single penny!!"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 20:16:33,Amazing
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 19:56:47,"Glad I got it on sale, definitely use some type of cleaning product 1st for best results"

5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 17:02:12,Updated review: I received my replacement and I am so happy with my steamer mop! The customer service was so helpful in solving my issue and sent my replacement immediately! Great product and the customer service is A+
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 16:15:18,"This product works so well and I absolutely love all the attachments it comes with. I’ve cleaned walls, windows and little cracks that are impossible to get things out of but this does it!"
2,Item: Default,2024-12-06 15:30:45,"Was super excited about this. The Mop head doesn't fit correctly so it doesn't ""click"" in so steam escapes. Switched over to one of the scrub/spongy heads and after a minute using it the blue part fell off then the whole sponge separated from the head."
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 14:44:46,This was the best purchase I’ve made in years! This steam mop is so much better than the spin mop I was using. This worked so well I got one for my parents. They can’t stop thanking me for it.
4,Item: Default,2024-12-06 14:25:05,Awesome little steam cleaner!! It works well on just about everything!! Makes cleaning your stovetop and bathrooms a breeze!!
4,Item: Default,2024-12-06 11:27:41,"It works wonderfully!! Only thing I have issue with is 1 of the attachments, didn't finish cleaning what I was working on before it came apart. Love all the attachments and settings, and I can use the extender for all of the pieces."
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 11:23:56,"I love this steam cleaner/mop! It’s addicting, you will want to clean everything with it!"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 11:12:47,We are absolutely THRILLED with this purchase! Our kitchen tiles are over 35+ years old and are the most bizarre texture that traps dirt and grime. We were debating between several options but landed on this and are so happy with our purchase
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 11:06:44,Works quite well but I wish the water tank was larger.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 10:40:50,Honestly it did everything I hoped it would! I don’t think there’s anything negative about it. I did have to refill the water tank several times but I wouldn’t change that bc it would make it bulkier. It’s a no-regret purchase. Easy to use out the box! I washed the pads as promised they are reusable
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 10:17:38,Fast shipping!!
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 10:07:04,I’m giving it as a gift!
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 09:53:30,I give this 10 stars!!! Prefect to clean absolutely everything. After using it and loving it I bought one for my daughter and my coworker..
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 08:32:27,"So perfect for cleaning! I am obsessed. Great for my gas cooktop, shower, floors. Anything you can of!!"
1,Item: Default,2024-12-06 08:23:02,So far I love it. Mopped the floor cleaned the oven cleaned the tub. Works great!! Wish the water tank was a bit bigger. UPDATE. I have used this 10 times and it broke yesterday. So far I have not heard back from the seller. Was great whole it lasted but it is a big price to pay for it to break .
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 06:08:57,Great product! Worked wonders on my moms cupboards!
4,Item: Default,2024-12-06 01:28:10,Not enough steam
5,Item: Default,2024-12-06 00:03:37,Love it! Easy to use! Gets rid of the crud.
1,Item: Default,2024-12-05 22:50:31,i haven't opened yet but it only took 4 days and
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 22:40:27,I love this thing. It heats up fast and the tank is small enough to not be heavy and large enough not to have to continuously refill it!
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 22:10:45,This works nice. Not big or hard to move around. Several attachments.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 21:05:29,Literally the best money spent
1,Item: Default,2024-12-05 21:02:37,Basically a swiffer mop that looks fancy because it blows out steam. But the steam is useless. Didn’t really do much to stove or doors. Just moved the dirt around in liquid form. Useful for low maintenance mopping. Like a quick little lazy mop. Would not recommend go buy a swiffer.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 20:47:46,I bought this to use in my cleaning business. I love it! It converts easily and works great on shower grout and floors. It’s really quiet too which is a plus.

4,Item: Default,2024-12-05 18:53:28,Love the mop itself. One of the attachment's fell apart the very first use but other than that everything works and it’s a good product.

5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 14:51:48,Update: I was happy with this purchase until it stopped working 3 weeks after I bought it. it makes a clicking sound and does t produce steam. I’ve been emailing and calling the manufacture with no answer or response. I can’t get a hold of the manufacture.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 14:50:13,Believe how fast I got it I just ordered two Two days ago that’s why I’m TikTok client They take care of you

1,Item: Default,2024-12-05 14:37:08,"Bad quality, is not as easy as it was in the promotional Video"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 14:28:32,"This product is short of amazing with all of the separate gadgets, it makes getting that professional home cleaning easy! The shipping is fast and came right on time. I just purchased a new home and this mop and steamer helped me clean the old apartment and that those stubborn oven spills."
2,Item: Default,2024-12-05 14:14:24,Works great the only issue I have is the connecting parts won't lock in. I have to stop every few minutes to try to get it to stay and then heat up again. Other then that this thing kinda made me feel I need to clean way better.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 13:55:19,"I have used the steamer mop to sanitize and clean my floors, used the brush part to clean my couch and sanitized my daughter’s toys. I love it!!!"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 13:47:12,Absolutely Awesome!
3,Item: Default,2024-12-05 12:21:24,I bought it thinking it would get the white scale off caused by my water. I have tried everything I have found nothing to date has worked. I have a less than a year old house so it's not like it's been building up. The mop did not get it off. I did it twice still has white scale.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 12:12:21,This steamer is amazing I love the fact I can use it to clean anything in my new house!
5,Item: Default,2024-12-05 11:38:45,"I've only used this twice so far, I can get lazy. Lol. BUT I was very happy when I used it. Its impressive. I am happy with my purchase!"

4,Item: Default,2024-12-05 08:17:28,"I would’ve given 5 stars but the only thing I don’t really like is the small water tank. BUT once refilled, it heats up in no time. Definitely lived up to the hype!"
4,Item: Default,2024-12-05 07:48:22,I used it to remove flaking water-based paint from a door and it worked like a charm! Made scrubbing that much easier. So it paid for itself right there. Other things came clean easier and even removed *some* stubborn stains (but not all). Handy to have around!
5,Item: Default,2024-12-04 23:07:04,"Another product I was skeptical of but I’m so impressed with how fast it heats up and it’s so easy to use. I’m steaming everything in my house, and with 2 dogs tracking in everything across my tile floors, this mop gets a true workout!

1,Item: Default,2024-12-04 13:37:22,I ordered this steam mop. They sent my package to the wrong address. I have the pictures to prove it. I requested a refund they denied my request and now there’s no way to get in contact with the seller to get my money back. Never will I ever order this place again mind you I ordered two of these.

5,Item: Default,2024-12-04 09:35:49,This is a decent steam mop but what really makes it worth it is the ease in which you can change from mop to handheld steamer. Perfect for when you are moping and want to get the baseboard or a spot on the wall.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-04 09:22:41,"I have tried this on my floor got everything up that was stuck, The first one I got sent wasn’t working correctly, but they gladly sent me a new one so I would be able to try it. It works amazing"
2,Item: Default,2024-12-04 08:39:18,The videos were a bit misleading it didn’t really clean as well as they stated it would in several videos. Definitely gotta put some back into it even with small clean ups. Still a good mop but nothing like the promotion videos said.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-04 08:38:39,"Loving this so far. Did my walls , doors and floors."

5,Item: Default,2024-12-03 15:32:05,"Glad I finally decided to buy one, lifted off some tough stains I have been fighting with. Only thing I would think of changing is maybe making the water tank a little bigger other than that I love this thing"

5,Item: Default,2024-12-03 14:36:08,This is just using water! I loved it. It cleaned so well. I had to keep refilling just because the floor was dirty but it was worth it. I used it on my Laminated floor as well and I didn’t see any bubbles. It was great and I didn’t have to fill constantly. The cord is also pretty long too.

5,Item: Default,2024-12-03 12:18:30,I absolutely love this thing. I bought this item I'm not an influencer and it's legit. I was hesitant to buy and held off for about 2 weeks before writing the review and I'm here to say I love it. It makes cleaning everything so much easier. Ive done a little of everything and it kills it.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-03 12:08:26,Cleaned all of my walls in 20 minutes I love it !!
4,Item: Default,2024-12-03 11:37:22,Works very well. Would prefer a slightly longer extension tube as a 5’11” person. The grout brush attachments work well but the bristles deform quickly.
4,Item: Default,2024-12-03 11:13:57,I absolutely love how well this cleans! I also added a few drops of my favorite oils for the smell and 5 days later my house STILL smells amazing. I did have an issue with the slender bristles melting but it could have been user error as I was scrubbing a sticky gunk off of our new flooring.

5,Item: Default,2024-12-03 07:12:21,I love this steam mop & all of the attachments! It has been a lifesaver! The pads are super easy to clean as well as the smaller attachments!
1,Item: Default,2024-12-03 06:58:13,I expected more from this product to be honest
5,Item: Default,2024-12-03 06:00:19,Quality of work: I love how clean it gets ALL my surfaces. it got up years of gunk I couldn’t get off Performance: It’s super quiet and the cord goes pretty far. I’m happy with my purchase

4,Item: Default,2024-12-03 00:13:23,"My only complaint is that I wish there was an off switch (instead of unplugging the power cord). That said, I really enjoy the product and have been excitedly cleaning things like my painted brick mantle and revealing just how dirty it actually was 🫣🫢"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-02 23:25:00,Works well and easy to use.

5,Item: Default,2024-12-02 21:46:35,Definitely a must for bathrooms! It is great for cleaning tiles. I also find that it worked well on our hardwood floors floors. I will say that be prepared to be shocked by the amount of dirt it picks up😩😩 you never know how dirty your place is.

4,Item: Default,2024-12-02 21:01:23,Used it tonight on my porcelain tile floors. I have two dogs and this took care of some difficult spots on the tile and corners of the baseboards. I wouldn’t say it’s of great quality but it is doing the job.

2,Item: Default,2024-12-02 19:09:21,I don’t really like this mop. It’s easy to use but it doesn’t clean.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-02 18:09:36,This product is a game changer when it comes to really cleaning my house! The nooks and cranny’s that typically get missed by a vacuum/mop build up over time and this steam mop was able to get rid of the built up grime completely! I pondered buying this for months. Now I wish I got it sooner!!
4,Item: Default,2024-12-02 17:50:02,I did a video with a complete breakdown of this product
3,Item: Default,2024-12-02 17:48:45,Nice steam cleaner but two of the attachments already fell apart which was disappointing! I like it but which it came with a few more spare attachments!
1,Item: Default,2024-12-02 17:46:35,I didn’t get my package
4,Item: Default,2024-12-02 17:31:27,"The main attachment is really hard to attach. However, the cleanliness this product provides is exceptional. My oven did not come out as clean as the advertised video showed in TikTok. The floors and bathroom sink came out really clean."
4,Item: Default,2024-12-02 17:11:29,I like it and opened and started using just out of the box.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-02 16:03:16,"Absolutely love how it looks—just like the picture! Plus, the company is incredibly responsive to customers, making the whole experience even better."
4,Item: Default,2024-12-02 15:40:43,What's great the only issue I saw was it was pink
4,Item: Default,2024-12-02 14:55:56,I love the convenience of not having to make a bucket of mop water. I just plug in my steam mop add water and go.

5,Item: Default,2024-12-02 13:22:16,Loosened up the dirt on all my floors and didn’t kill my back in the process.
1,Item: Default,2024-12-02 10:48:20,I placed a order for 2 steam mops on Black Friday and it was weird to me that they weren’t shipping together but anyways I received 1 of my mops and not the other one I have contacted customer support and I’m not getting through to anyone this is the second time I’ve been scammed through tik tok!
4,Item: Default,2024-12-02 10:16:26,"I was super excited to get this. I have young kids and being able to steam clean hard to reach areas, especially in the bathroom, was exciting! I used this handheld in the bathroom and watched it blast away ick from under the hinges that I could never get. Worth it for that alone!"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-02 09:19:49,"We bought a 1958 house that’s a fixer upper, and this mop is taking grime that’s been stuck for years off! When normal cleaning wouldn’t get the junk off, this did. Proof that a little bit of elbow grease and patience can do wonders. I was super hesitant to buy from TikTok, but I’m glad I did."
3,Item: Default,2024-12-02 08:11:50,"Don’t hate it, but don’t love it either. Does the job, comes with lots of tools for various reasons."

5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 19:19:54,So far I have loved the streamer mop. It does everything I expected and even posted a video of my review in my tiktok page!
4,Item: Default,2024-12-01 18:59:34,"It is a nice steamer, but seems mostly made for cleaning glass and other small objects as opposed to the floor. Tbf, we do have a larger floor plan, but the steam doesn’t last long due to the relatively small water receptacle. It was really great for cleaning plastic kids toys."
5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 18:38:30,easy to use and effective on all surfaces!

5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 17:37:25,"I love this steam mop! It has tackled the yuck on my walls, windows, countertops, and floors. I love that it’s chemical free and easy to use!

5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 17:17:30,"This works perfectly. So good it took the paint off the wall when I got over zealous and wanted to do the wall. It has cleaned my grout, glass top stove, & painted brick fireplace. I have a ton of super clean areas since I was like a squirrel when I first got it I was going from place to place."

5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 16:02:17,"Absolutely love this thing! Makes me want to clean even more. Only thing is when you’re cleaning stuff up higher, it struggles a little with sucking up water to create steam. But other than that it’s definitely worth the price!"

5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 14:45:49,"Lightweight, easy to use"
4,Item: Default,2024-12-01 14:40:28,It’s not a bad product and does still work. It just did not work well enough to use solely as a mop on my tiled floors. Maybe it could depend on the type of flooring you have for it to work better. I will say this company itself is amazing and has great customer service.
2,Item: Default,2024-12-01 14:23:56,"I was so excited to receive this product after all the reviews and videos. I was completely underwhelmed with it's performance. The sponge attachment fell apart after the first use, the mop head was difficult to keep steady while cleaning and wasn't as high powered in performance as made to believe."

5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 12:09:30,"Bought as a gift for my mom after using mine once, best purchase all year!"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 12:07:52,I have never been so excited and happy to clean. This steam mop is a game changer and honestly the best purchase I’ve made all year. I recommend buying extra pads because you will want to clean every surface. After using one time I went back online to buy my mom one. Buy it you won’t regret it!
5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 11:15:33,I was skeptical of ordering this bc the reviews were so good - but I am actually obsessed. Not me cleaning my entire house with it. It takes a little getting used to but honestly works great. I did all my floor boards and bathrooms easily. The cord is long and it’s easy to use. I love it.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 11:09:34,Great mop for the price. Really cleaned our grout and floors. Looked almost professional
5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 10:58:17,"This steam cleaner let me clean up some old paint stuck to floor.I cleaned stove, windows, walls and places I don’t normally clean. It was worth the price just to get my home extra sparkly. The two reusable washable floor pads are nice. I always unplug it when I’m done bc it seems to heat the water"
5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 10:55:56,Great product! Easy to assemble and easy to use. I have had other steam mops in the past and this one has become my favorite. I would definitely recommend!

2,Item: Default,2024-12-01 09:49:14,I’m returning it because the cord was not that long and the steam power was low. It didn’t have a smaller attachment for fibers like the other ones on here and the sponge attachments are not for constant use because you will have to replace them. Over all it was a weak steamer so I am returning.
5,Item: Default,2024-12-01 08:49:33,"As many others, I was hesitant to purchase basing myself on the videos but was quickly persuaded once I used my steam mop. It definitely cuts the time you’ll spend cleaning and disinfecting your home. I have a young child running around so it helps to know I’m not using harsh chemicals to clean."

5,Item: Default,2024-11-30 19:02:01,This is legit! I love it soo much! Floors feel so much cleaner then sprays.
2,Item: Default,2024-11-30 18:51:29,"takes forever till the steam start , then you have to use your strength pressing on the machine on the floor so you can actually see the heat and this team come out and you are mopping You have to vacuum the floor before because it wouldn’t take anything it just wetting the floor it’s cheap machine"

5,Item: Default,2024-11-30 14:30:21,"The best steamer ever,"
3,Item: Default,2024-11-30 14:25:44,"Unfortunately it didn’t quite work for me. The steam struggles to come out if you’re holding it in any direction besides as if you were mopping a floor, which makes it hard to use for any other task (walls, shower, etc). The accessories were also cheap and several of them broke after just one use :/"

4,Item: Default,2024-11-21 21:36:19,It’s surprisingly great. Works wonderfully and really gets the tough stains out. The only reason I give it 4 stars is for the attachments durability. If it is for simple cleanups and light daily use there would be no issue. But for strenuous use it’s best to already purchase attachment replacements

1,Item: Default,2024-11-20 18:49:19,Mop does not clean the fllors like the videos show. It just wipes up dust n sanitizes. To be honest for the price its a 0 to me it better to just mop

4,Item: Default,2024-11-20 16:12:44,Seems to do a good job but the wand and steam head are REALLY hard to snap on! I have to fight with it for a good while to get it on. Almost like the plastic it snaps into is to big. Once i get it on it works great!
5,Item: Default,2024-11-20 14:56:28,"My other streamer broke and after much deliberation, decided to go with this one. I like the size and ease of use and the attachments it comes with are great."

2,Item: Default,2024-11-20 05:48:11,I was hoping it would be much stronger. It didn't match the video reviews. Not much steam came out so I was overall disappointed and had to return it. I also didn't like the attachments. It didn't run out of water too quickly which was good but overall didn't fit my needs or expectations.
5,Item: Default,2024-11-20 00:59:52,Obsessed with this cleaning device. So easy. Light weight.
3,Item: Default,2024-11-19 23:28:24,Did not have as much success cleaning my walls as advertised in the video - the wall under the counter where the bar stools are… no good. Kids bedroom walls… a little better. Hallway and floors came out decent. I suppose decent for the price.

3,Item: Default,2024-11-14 23:08:38,"The steamer is ok, not that powerful. You have to use it on the highest level to even get results. It does come with a great number of special attachments & the water cup makes it really easy to fill, also the cord is a great length. Power is lacking."

1,Item: Default,2024-11-14 16:41:24,"Highly disappointed. Very cheaply made, the nozzles are very odd, and the steam randomly stops during use. Dont fall for it just because it’s advertised by someone you follow, they are just posting to make money. Skip this product, you can find better."
5,Item: Default,2024-11-14 16:34:10,"Handy and light weight, did a great job cleaning my glass windows/doors! Only con is that because it’s super lightweight you have to manually apply pressure when steam mopping over hard spots. Other than that it’s great so far!"

5,Item: Default,2024-11-14 11:06:54,"I really like this steam mop. I like that it it's versatile and can be handheld. Heats up very fast. Super effective at cleaning.

5,Item: Default,2024-11-14 08:11:02,"Love the steam mop, it does so many things and makes cleaning a breeze.

2,Item: Default,2024-11-11 12:15:09,Only good thing about this is the attachment they offer however mine must of been defective because there was virtually no steam that would come out.

3,Item: Default,2024-11-09 09:20:19,This does not clean the way it is advertised unfortunately. It also leaves a lot of water on surfaces and floor.
5,Item: Default,2024-11-09 08:32:24,"I got this item to clean grout and inside of my oven, when item was delivered I went to town! I was having so much fun and it was getting the job done quick.

5,Item: Default,2024-11-08 16:59:40,Blasts that dirt away
4,Item: Default,2024-11-08 16:59:04,It’s does a good job. I would definitely wait for a sale. I gave it 4 stars because the scrubbing attachment already broke after one use. Other than that it works great.

2,Item: Default,2024-11-03 18:15:19,Can live without it. Not as “great” as others say. Doesn’t steam away tough stains. Needs to be used with cleaning solutions and/or chemicals.

5,Item: Default,2024-11-02 08:57:20,Nice but the steam gets so hot it melted some of the pieces
2,Item: Default,2024-11-02 08:48:39,**DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ITS ONLY GOOD FOR A COOLE OF USES THEN IT STOPS WORKING. It was good while it lasted which was two weeks.
5,Item: Default,2024-11-02 08:03:51,Love that it vacuums both floor and carpet and picks up all the dog hair. Battery last long too just wish the cord was different to wrap around wit handles but overall a must have so much better than sweeping

1,Item: Default,2024-11-02 03:33:56,Not very powerful. Steam only helps loosen the dirt. Doesn’t really clean it. Isn’t strong enough to actually clean grime off. Performance: Weak Capacity: Have to refill the water tank often.
4,Item: Default,2024-11-01 23:58:19,Love this! I just wish the water reservoir was bigger!
5,Item: Default,2024-11-01 22:09:52,I love the options I have to not only clean the floors but my huge mirror wall as well! It's top to bottom mirror and a headache until I got this! Great product and easy to use!

5,Item: Default,2024-11-01 13:35:01,Wonderful customer service
4,Item: Default,2024-11-01 12:51:50,So far so good. It gets really hot but when you handle the attachments after you've used it it's really not too hot to the touch. Although sometimes with the smaller attachments when you use them for a while The heat loosens up the plastic and they can slip off if you're not careful.
5,Item: Default,2024-11-01 10:12:43,"I give this a chin store if I can, but I do give it a five star. It is very good steam mop the best I ever had so you all need to purchase this. It do what it say it do."

4,Item: Default,2024-10-31 14:45:05,"Overall I really like it. I haven’t used it as much, but 2 reasons why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I can’t put any chemicals into the water tank (obviously) so for mopping the floors it may not be the best on a regular basis and the cord could be longer to be honest."
5,Item: Default,2024-10-31 13:17:43,Amazing product!

1,Item: Default,2024-10-30 18:49:13,I was really sold on this and it was the first thing I have bought on TikTok shop. I was really unimpressed with it. I didn’t feel like the floor mop worked at all. I would not recommend this item. Don’t let the videos fool you!

4,Item: Default,2024-10-30 12:23:51,Love the product especially when it comes to cleaning the oven with it! The sponge attachment does fall apart after a couple of uses. If there were at least an extra sponge attachment and bristle that would make it so much better. Overall the product was a good buy!
4,Item: Default,2024-10-30 10:26:05,Very good quality product! All of the attachments are perfect for everyday household needs.

1,Item: Default,2024-10-25 18:17:14,I tried many areas of my home thinking this would clean well like all of the videos and I am so disappointed. For 100 dollars it does not do anything special. Youre better off with soap and a sponge.
5,Item: Default,2024-10-25 17:20:13,Love this thing! I have used it on my floors and as a handheld. Would definitely recommend. I have another brand that only does floors and this one is way better all around.

4,Item: Default,2024-10-25 11:51:27,I’ve only used it once and so far so good. No major complaints. It does have a really long cord. It heats up super fast and has multiple attachments. It doesn’t need a lot of water to keep going. I did fill it up a few times to keep the steamer going.
5,Item: Default,2024-10-25 11:37:41,Great product. I purchased it to clean my grout (tile floors) without having to sit on the floor. Works great.

5,Item: Default,2024-10-24 19:00:23,This was worth every penny we spent. Our grout was absolutely disgusting. Kept seeing the videos of this thing doing grout and thought what do we have to loose. Let me tell you we lost nothing instead we finally gained clean floors. As you can see from the picture the difference is night and day.
1,Item: Default,2024-10-24 16:47:30,Package was not left where told too. Left Package where it could be stolen. To lazy to take to back porch where was asked too
4,Item: Default,2024-10-24 15:57:15,"Steam mop works good. I'm frugal so that price tag i was hoping for a lot more, but still works great. Love how clean it makes my floors. The real test is in a few days when I try and clean my oven. Haha customer service 10/10 tho"

5,Item: Default,2024-10-24 07:53:01,I did not believe the hype of how it cleans so good so I purchased it. I must say I cleaned one of my doors and the walls going up the steps. They are so clean this is a must have. I will be cleaning everything on my next day off. That day will be strictly for steam cleaning walls and all. Go buy
5,Item: Default,2024-10-24 07:48:49,Immediately opened it when I received the package. It is very easy to put together and has a number of accesories. Tried it out on my kitchen and bathroom floors and it worked great.

1,Item: Default,2024-10-24 06:10:15,"I wanted to love this, but I do not see a difference when using a regular mop vs this. It did not remove the marks on my wall like I saw it remove marks in a TikTok video. I used a Mr. clean sponge, and that took of the marks on the wall. I did not save the outside box otherwise, I would return it."
5,Item: Default,2024-10-24 04:42:25,"Update: even though the product didn’t end up being what I had hoped, the customer service is beyond amazing. They reached out and asked if wanted a replacement or refund. I can’t emphasize how rare it is for a company to stand by their product this way!"

5,Item: Default,2024-10-23 17:18:19,I had a stain on my wood floor where a jar of blackberry jelly had been knocked off the shelf in my walk in pantry. This steam mop made the wood release that and it faded by half with the first use. 2 more uses and you can barely see where it was now. I'm impressed with it.

Seller: the seller was really nice and efficient
5,Item: Default,2024-10-23 11:07:51,Works great!
5,Item: Default,2024-10-23 08:59:06,"This steam mop is incredible but it is much more than a mop!

Performance: Quality design that really performs!"
5,Item: Default,2024-10-23 08:47:00,Got my steam mop within the time frame. Fast delivery! Can’t wait to try out my steam mop!
3,Item: Default,2024-10-23 07:53:54,While this product does work ok it's more for use at home then it is for use in my cleaning business. Not really a time saver and doesn't actually do what is seen in videos. Water needs to be refilled often and there's no off button so needs to be unplugged to fill out put down.
5,Item: Default,2024-10-23 07:28:43,i’ve been wanting to get a steamer mop for a while & saw this all over my fyp. it easily loosens up any stuck on dirt and is a great base clean before going in with my normal mop! it’s versatile with the attachments and can be handheld or used for floors.

5,Item: Default,2024-10-23 01:01:16,"This is my favorite tik tok purchase! It is no joke! It has all the right attachments, run time is sufficient, cord is nice and long. Since I’ve had it I’ve been cleaning everything! Makes cleaning so much easier. If you’ve been considering buying this stop and hit the buy button. It’s a necessity"
3,Item: Default,2024-10-22 23:14:09,I love it! The only lame thing is the long part isn’t adjustable so you can’t change the length. You get 2 pads and they stick on kind of ugly. The parts are awesome! The water reservoir could be larger as well. Cute easy cleaning!
1,Item: Default,2024-10-22 22:06:01,So disappointed with the hype vs quality! One use and the scrub part fell apart in 20 min. I could hold my hand in front of the steam with no burning! I was so looking forward to this but it’s been a complete failure! Quality of work: Poor Performance: Poor Capacity: Runs outta water quick Design: Hard to get to areas Size: Ok I guess

5,Item: Default,2024-10-04 11:22:24,"This steam machine is quality, priced great Cleaned my kitchen thoroughly and it's easy to clean up quick messes because of how portable and easy to handle it is.

4,Item: Default,2024-10-03 10:38:09,It is a great product but it is not as good as I thought it would be. I do wish it held more water as it does not last long and I wish the pink scrub pads done a better job at scrubbing. Size: The size is perfect
5,Item: Default,2024-10-03 10:33:13,"I am a professional house cleaner and this has gotten years of gunk off one of my clients tile shower floor. The grout attachment is amazing and It heats up fast. It's easy to work with in tight spots, I definitely recommend."
3,Item: Default,2024-10-03 10:05:02,I cleaned my bathroom I eventually stopped using it and just started cleaning it with a scrubber and cleaner I like the mirror attachment The mop attachment is good.

I love the slim design which makes it easy to use and store. Of course the pink makes it that much cuter! The deep clean feel it gives is worth every penny!

4,Item: Default,2024-10-02 23:01:04,I love mopping w/ this. The cord is a good length and I can get my house done quickly. No mop bucket of nasty water to dump. Just toss the pad in the wash. I love using the attachments. It makes cleaning a breeze. I do think it can be a bit awkward to handle sometimes. Tank could be bigger.

5,Item: Default,2024-10-02 22:17:37,This steam mop has exceeded my expectations and I’ve only used it once. I can’t wait to continue to use this. I have always struggled with cleaning the risers of my stairs and this mop made it so easy! As an added bonus it’s in my favorite color pink!

5,Item: Default,2024-10-02 15:52:01,This mop has helped make my home so much cleaner in a short space of time. The tank might seem small but the water lasted longer than I thought it would and it got up so much dirt and grime I’ve been struggling to clean for months! So happy I purchased

5,Item: Default,2024-10-02 15:36:59,Love it… I used it the day it came and cleaned my floors. It made mopping easy and quick. I never seen dirt lift so easy and my floors have been shining since!!!

5,Item: Default,2024-09-29 14:05:19,"This steam mop is hands down the best! What I love most is how versatile it is—you can detach the bottom to turn it into a handheld device, perfect for cleaning windowsills, bathrooms, and even windows. It really does it all! I used it recently to clean my grout, and it worked amazingly well.see vid"

5,Item: Default,2024-09-11 00:39:36,Would highly recommend getting the Schenley steam mop. Not only does it work beautifully (cleaned my dirty grout that hasn’t been cleaned in years) but I would also recommend it because they have the best customer service. My first mop came broken and they immediately sent me a new one. Performance: Works great
5,Item: Default,2024-08-23 13:41:26,"My sponge and squeegee attachment broke & I was sent new ones for free & extra grout attachments this product is great.Amazing product & deal from a good company,they reached out to me after my 1st review! Love this steamer doors, floors,& base boards look amazing! Don’t think about it just buy it"
3,Item: Default,2024-08-17 13:53:55,"I love the steam mop, I mainly got it for my ceramic tile flooring. After using the mop it made floor look brand new. And I’ve only completed half the kitchen so far. The assembly pieces could be a lot better. I’ve ran through just about all the scrub brush pieces provided. They wear so fast."
5,Item: Default,2024-08-17 12:15:53,"One of the best purchases ever!! Have never owned a steamer before & this one is amazing! Takes paint off my floor, revives my wood floor. Cleans grout easily.

5,Item: Default,2024-08-14 20:52:53,this steamer deserves some kudos. We have tile all downstairs in our house, roughly 1200sq. ft. Tile that is 10+ yrs old & grout I can’t remember ever cleaning but once. We restored the grout within hours to new. amazing product! A must buy and well worth the price. Hope the pics do it justice
3,Item: Default,2024-07-31 13:08:13,The steam that the mop produces is great not as powerful as I wished it was. I didn't realize it came w/ all the attachments because it wasn't advertised off the video I bought it from but I was surprised! The very 1st day I used the scrub it broke. Would not buy again but will continue to use.
5,Item: Default,2024-07-29 13:17:24,This is AMAZING especially for cleaning years of dirt out if grout. The hot steam is like a magic eraser and all the dirt melts right out within a few seconds. I also love that it also sanitizes as it cleans. Our floors look brand new. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5,Item: Default,2024-05-26 00:03:29,I have used this handy steamer to clean almost everything! I’ve even used it in my truck to get the coffee stains and spills off the seats and cup holders. Today I used it in my bathroom to clean the cabinets, walls and baseboards. I’ve attached a video of it cleaning the baseboards. It’s great!!
5,Item: Default,2024-05-02 01:56:40,I love this thing. I bought it originally to help with grout and baseboards. It melts the dirt right off of whatever you are cleaning. No more scrubbing and back breaking labor. The new design is sturdy and easy to maneuver. I love the rotating head and I love the multiple attachments. 10 out of 10!
4,Item: Default,2024-03-13 12:22:50,This mop is amazing. Our grout was practically black when we purchased our home. Turns out it was supposed to be a light tan color. I did knock a star off because I realized you are not able to buy replacement attachments just replacement pads. The grout brush wore out very quickly.
5,Item: Default,2024-02-16 04:14:57,This mop os so amazing.. my husband never clean hi oven when i took the schenley mop and use it with brush it work well..this is fantastic!
